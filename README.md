# VOICE-CONTROLLED-ROBOT
Here in this project we will control the robot by over voice. This project is developed by using python and IoT application so this will be implemented in real world application moreover we can control the robot by giving our voice-over .
Voice Controlled Robot – Description

A Voice Controlled Robot is an intelligent robotic system that can be operated through human voice commands. Instead of using remotes, joysticks, or manual controls, the robot relies on speech recognition technology to interpret spoken instructions and perform specific actions such as moving forward, backward, left, right, or stopping.

The main components of a voice-controlled robot include:

- Microphone / Voice Input Module – Captures the spoken commands.
- Speech Recognition Module (e.g., Google Speech API, Arduino-compatible module, Bluetooth with smartphone app) – Converts voice into machine-readable signals.
- Microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or similar) – Processes the commands and controls the actuators.
- Motor Driver & Motors – Drive the wheels or mechanical parts based on instructions.
- Power Supply – Battery or external power source.

How it Works:

- User gives a command (e.g., “Move forward”).
- The microphone captures the voice and sends it to the recognition system.
- The speech recognition system converts it into digital data.
- The microcontroller processes the data and triggers the respective action.
- Motors/actuators execute the movement accordingly.

Applications:

- Assisting physically challenged people in controlling devices.
- Human-robot interaction in smart homes.
- Military and defense operations.
- Industrial automation where hands-free control is needed.
- Educational projects for learning robotics and AI.

Advantages:

- Hands-free and user-friendly operation.
- Can be customized for multiple commands.
- Improves accessibility for people with disabilities.
